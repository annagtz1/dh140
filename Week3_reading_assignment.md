# Open Street Map for Humanitarian Causes: Reflection

The use of open data to map previously unmapped areas is a really great cause. Using data to help make decisions for long term projects, assist communities in recieiving resources, or figure out what it is areas need is valuable. As Rachel Levine says, this use of open data helps build infastructure support for old and new communities alongside the volunteer work behind mapping unmapped areas. I also think close communication and collaboration with community members themseleves is benefical for a variety of reasons, with a crucial one being that communitiy memebers know their communities and the community needs the best. In addition, many problems can be addressed and conceptualized with data that may have been previously unknown before. Gender pay inequity wouldn't have be known as an issue if it were not for data as supporting evidence that a wage gap exists. It is through this knowledge uncovered by data that can not only further discussion and education but also promote action towards a pressing issue. Another way Levine points out how data and data collection are used to address different causes was the community epidemic and pandemic prepardness project. Using new and old data helped understand needs during a pandemic that are life saving and crucial for public health. Lastly, with any data use there needs to be conversations around responibility and accountabilty. Much like how open data can be used for progress and assitance towards humanitarian causes, it can also cause significant harm.
