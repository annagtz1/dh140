Your thoughts on using open data for humanitarian causes

Your thoughts on how open data can be used for different causes

What do you think you (and your cohort) can do with open data to make this world a better place?

I think the use of open data to map previously unmapped areas is really great. Using data for helping makings decisions for long term projects or help communities recieive resources or figure out what communities need is really beneficial. This helps build infastructure support for old and new communities, such as the volunteer work behind mapping areas needing to be mapped. I also think close communication and collaboration with community members themseleves is great, for a variety of reasons but a big one being that communitiy memebers would know thier areas best. A lot of problems can be addresses and conceptualized with data that may have been previously unknown before. Gender pay inequity wouldn't have be know if it were not for data presented the the wage gap, and this knowldge furthers discussion and action towards the issue. Another way to use open data and data collection to address different causes was the community epidemic and pandemic prepardness project desrcibed by Rachel Levine. Using new and old data helps to understand the needs during a pandemic can be life saving and crucial for public health. But with any data use, there needs to be conversations around responibility and accountabilty. Much like open data can be used to be progress and help causes, it can also cause immense harm when used nefariously, buisness motivated, or just unintentionally. A consideration of ethics and right to privacy is good to consider while also aiming to help humanitatian causes, because there is so much poetential to do a lot of good with data. [EDIT THIS]
