## Prompt ##
This week's reading assignment is for you to find an article, blog, journal, chapter, or book that talks about data/information/knowledge/coding that includes some spatial/coding/data science component. Make sure it is something that you would like to share with the class. Then, write a paragraph (yes, a paragraph, not two) that summarizes the article. Write a second paragraph where you reflect critically and creatively about the material in your own words. Why did this article speak to you in regards to your approach to data and research? How does it inform you own data science goals?

[Five Thirty Eight: Why The Suburbs Have Shifted Blue ](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-suburbs-have-shifted-blue/)

## Summary and Reflection ##
  Demographics of American suburbs are shifting, with a shifts way Trump support across the country, as well as increasing diversity and education status. Political science professor at Duke University, Ashley Jardina, sees racial diversity as a factor that exists alongside growing educational attainment in what shapes racial attitudes among white people. A diversity index by USA Today that calculates the chance that any two people chosen at random from a given area are of different races found that suburbs have grown more diverse in the past decade. This was especially true in battleground states such as Georgia, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan, all of which were crucial for Biden's election performance this year. But when looking deeper into the voting behavior of these suburbs, there was not a uniform shift towards Democrats. Instead, education levels increased over the past 10 years, which was found to me more closely related with increased support for Biden. Overall, suburban counties that became more diverse _and_ educated saw a shift in their vote margin towards Biden support. However, as argued by Jardina, increased support for the Democractic party will depend on the party's ability to mobilze these increasingly diverse suburbs to stay energized and voting. 
  
  I choose this article because I liked the way it incorporated demographic data about American suburbs while also looking at education to tie a narrtive back into voting behavior. I think apart from the interesting political insights that were gained, looking at the way suburbs are changing overall is facinating and worth discussion on its own. The data was also presented using spatial visualizations like the first county map presented in the article. In addition, the research also used statistical analysis to draw some more insights about the data. In regards to my own approach to data and research, I liked the incorporation of data science methods and spatial visualizations to better understand American suburbs and American politics, two people-centric social topics. In regards to my own research goals, I look to gain more experience and knowledge of doing similar projects.
